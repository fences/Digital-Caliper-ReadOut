# INSIZE Digital Caliper ReadOut
One of the features of digital calipers is the possibility of connecting them to a computer. In this way, you can transfer the measured data to the computer without typing. Friends who are familiar with concepts like SPC or MSA know how much reading the measurement data and recording it directly in the computer can make the process easier and reduce errors. You need an interface for this connection. For example, for the caliper of INSIZE company, this interface is around 150 dollars. With a little patience, you can make this interface.

This project is based on the Curious Scientist's Project and I changed some codes and circuits because of INSIZE Caliper.
